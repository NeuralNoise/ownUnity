ownUnity
========

ownUnity is a free, open-source software to run a private social network of your own.

With ownUnity you can host your community on your own host and you do not need to be a it-professional to install it.
You do not need a database. Just put the two files on any shared host, that supports php, which the most will do.

That's it. Your community is up and running.

In this first version there is no administration needed.
All you can configure is done in a file called config.ini.php, which is self-explainig.

After putting these files on your host, create a folder called _files_ beside them and give write-permissions to it.
